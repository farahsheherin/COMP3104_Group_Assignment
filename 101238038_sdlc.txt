DevOps is important because it's a software development and 
operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.
DevOps is no more than a set of processes that coordinate to unify development teams and processes to complement software development. The main reason behind DevOps' popularity is that it allows enterprises to create and
improve products at a faster pace than traditional software development methods.

The DevOps solution involves automating IT governance and is even more effective with the application of agile development.
