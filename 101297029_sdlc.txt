Benefits of implementing DevOps with software development process (“Role of DevOps in Software Development Process,” 2020):

1.	Easy to Identify and Modify of Software Defects:
    With the better collaboration between development and IT operations, now it has become much easier to identify and
    modify the software defects early.

2.	Less Human Errors:
    With the help of DevOps, it is possible to control the amount of application failure by deploying frequent releases
    within a specific timeline.

3.	Significant Reliability:
    DevOps secures reliability along with smooth operation. Businesses who are using DevOps get faster deployment
    compared to those businesses who do not use DevOps.

    of the delivery.

5.	Increased Collaboration:
    DevOps raises collaboration between team members and encourage them to stay connected and work together. This helps
    to achieve the development goal fast.
