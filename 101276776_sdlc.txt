DevOps is a simple, abbreviated term derived from the words “development” and “operations”. It involves practicing the several tasks of application development in a specific manner. In broader terms, a combination of software development and IT operations is dubbed as DevOps. 

Before DevOps, software applications were developed with either the waterfall model or the AGILE development model:

The waterfall or sequential model was a pioneering approach in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). With this model, software development becomes a linear process where different phases and tasks are positioned successively. 
AGILE software development, on the other hand, involved the use of various approaches and the collaboration of multiple teams in SDLC. 
The linearity of the waterfall model and the cross-functionality of AGILE software development were still unable to ensure quick and continuous delivery of flawless software applications. 

DevOps Services came into play by effectively serving the purpose of reducing the time involved in SDLC for prompt deliveries and securing the continuous production of high-quality, foolproof software applications.

A DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance needs throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and deployment, to maintenance and updates.
